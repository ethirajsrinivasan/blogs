### Unexpected Turn: The Blue Fire of Mount Ijen

My childhood dream of visiting a volcano became a reality when I visited Mount Bromo in Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park. From sunrise at Mount Penanjakan to viewing Mount Bromo's crater, the journey was incredible. After a splendid experience, I got ready for my next day's exploration.

#### Anticipation and Disappointment: The Unexpected Turn at Mount Ijen's Blue Fire
After descending Mount Bromo and returning to our hotel, we immediately started to our destination at about noon. In between we had lunch at RM Handayani - Wisata Paiton. It is a beautiful place to have lunch by the lakeside and birds chirping around. We continued our journey then. By around 8 PM, we reached our hotel. We had dinner at our nearby cafe. I was so excited since the next day was the main attraction, to view the blue fire at Mount Ijen's crater. The blue flames were the result of ignited sulfuric gases coming out from the cracks of the volcano. When I checked with my guide on the next day's schedule we were asked to be ready at 2 AM. Something struck me. Since as per plan we were supposed to start at 12 AM. When I enquired further about it to my guide I got the shocking news that due to climatic conditions, the blue fire visiting hours were closed. I was upset.

#### Trek To Mount Ijen
We can't overcome nature's plan after all I believed that it was nature that got me on this trip. With heavy hearts, we started at 2 AM to Mount Ijen from our hotel. It was freezing cold out there once we reached the foothills. We started our ascend along with a bunch of fellow travelers to the top. The hike was not easy. Through the midway, the sun slowly started to rise. It was a beautiful sight as the sunlight revealed that we were surrounded by clouds and green mountains

#### Turquoise-colored Acidic Lake
Walking a few minutes ahead we could see that mountain slopes filled with volcanic soil and proof of eruptions in the past. We then saw the turquoise-colored acidic lake inside the crater. It looked mesmerizing surrounded by the rugged volcanic rock. Even though I was not able to view the blue fire I was so convinced to have made this trip to view this beautiful blue lake. We then descended into the crater to view the sulfuric gases emerging from the cracks. It is these gases that appear as blue flames during the night. As the day starts these blue flames will vanish. It was also heartbreaking to see a few miners mining sulfur with bare hands and selling it at a lower price. After taking some memorable photos we began to descend the hill.
