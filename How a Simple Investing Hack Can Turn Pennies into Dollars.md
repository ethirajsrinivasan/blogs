Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where we invest a fixed amount of money at a regular period into a particular investment regardless of its price. Through this investment strategy, we tend to buy more units at a lower asset price and fewer units at a higher asset price thereby smoothening/averaging the overall cost of the assets and increasing the number of units of the assets. The underlying motive is to focus on consistency rather than timing the market

#### The Pros of Dollar Cost Averaging
* **Disciplined Investment**: DCA brings discipline to our investment strategy. By investing at a fixed time we commit to saving and investing for our future financial needs.
* **Reduced Timing Risk**: Timing the market is quite impossible. By choosing DCA we tend to avoid the time risk since DCA is an investment at fixed time intervals when the prices are up or down and it reduces our risk by spreading across different prices. So we don't have to worry about timing the market and have to spend much time in the market
* **Reaping benefits from market downturns**: When the market is down we buy more units of our assets since we invest a fixed amount. These cheaper units will be appreciated when the market bounces back.
* **Emotional Resilient**: We all know the stock market is volatile and brings fear or greed when the market goes up or down. By choosing DCA we bring in a barrier to our emotional decisions and stick to our investment plan

#### The Cons of Dollar Cost Averaging
* **Missing Opportunity for Lump Sum Gains**: While DCA protects us from investing a huge amount at the wrong time of the market conditions it also prevents us from investing a huge amount when the market is on an upswing and missing the gains.
* **Underperformance in Bull Markets**: Assets prices increase steadily in a prolonged bull market. During this time DCA tends to buy lesser and lesser units with the fixed amount and its advantage of buying at lower cost is lost. Lump Sum investments at this time tend to perform better than DCA.
* **Transaction Costs**: Since we buy stocks at regular intervals we tend to pay transaction costs every time and this can reduce a portion of our overall investment amount.
* **Asset Selection**: While DCA is a stress-free investment strategy, asset selection plays a prior role. Even DCA cannot save us when we invest in bad assets.

`DCA is a solid investment strategy only when the asset selection is good.`

#### Conclusion:
Dollar Cost Averaging is a disciplined investment approach stressing the need for consistent investment rather the being afraid of market fluctuations.  Consistent Investment will help us in the smoothening of the average cost of our assets and give us long-term wealth accumulation. Like every other investment strategy, DCA has its disadvantages as well. It is important to consider both the pros and cons of the approach before performing your investment. Consider your financial constraints and goals before choosing the approach.
