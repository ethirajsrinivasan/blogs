## Looking Back at 2022
21 days since the new year 2023 began and I am going to review my goals for 2022. I know it's late but it better be late than never and this review will help me in my upcoming years.

My Goals of 2022

>2022 goals from my notes

## 1. Fitness /Weight Transformation
Weight transformation was my top goal for 2022. At the start of 2022, I was about 88 kgs and I was able to successfully reduce my weight to 75 kgs. I put in a lot of effort and tried various ways to reduce my weight and make myself fit.

## Steps
I used my daily number of steps as one of my measurement metrics for my healthy weight transformation. I achieved a daily average of 13317 steps. From January to October I never missed my daily average of 10000 steps. I peaked it during the month of September with 18031 steps. During the month of October, I traveled back to India for my marriage and couldn’t do as much physical activity as I was in Singapore.

## Walking
Walking is one activity I did tremendously in the year 2022. I started walking a few km a day during my first month and increased it over the next few months. The trajectory is up and down but I managed to walk 70 km per month from February to October. My best period was the month of August and September when I walked about 209 km and 185 km respectively. Walking is one of the fitness activities that I would like to continue forever at the same pace as it is also time-consuming

## Running
Running was my main cardio activity for my fitness. It started well during the first month of January when I used to run on a treadmill in the gym but I started to get knee pain towards the end of the month. My knee pain didn’t appear to reduce and I have to stop running for a few months for it to recover. My fitness goal should not be affected as well so that’s when I started walking a lot and my knee pain started to reduce as well. I was reluctant to run again since I had the fear of getting my knee pain again. After a few months I started outdoor running slowly and it to my surprise knee was all fine. I started running far and peaked at 60 km per month in August. Yes, it was the month of August when I burned a lot of calories and got in shape. End of the year since I was occupied with my marriage and ceremonies I couldn't concentrate much on my physical activities

## Cycling
A physical activity that I loved to do. As soon as I set my goal for 2022 I did a good amount of cycling in the first two months of the year and then my family visited me in Singapore so I couldn't continue the same over the next two months since I was spending time with my family and did a lot of walking together. In June my bicycle was under repair. A few weeks passed by I didn't get it repaired I procrastinated it. I procrastinated for so long that even today it is under repair. I feel terrible about it. I want to get my bicycle repaired and continue my cycling journey.

## Reading
Over the years I have been trying to cultivate the habit of reading on a regular basis. Unfortunately, I was not able to succeed it. 2022 was added as one of the worst years for my reading along with 2016 and 2018. I was unable to cultivate the habit because of a poor selection of books and my desire to read books only in a comfortable peaceful environment. Hopefully this year I will come up with good books and a peaceful environment.

## Writing Skills
A new skill that I wanted to try in 2022. Never really picked it up. Definitely this year I will give it a try. This article marks the first of my writing activity in 2023.

## Practice Yoga/ Mediation
One more new skill that I would like to do is practicing yoga/meditation. 2022 was not the year. I see a lack of knowledge on where to start on this. It is time I seek knowledge about it through books or some wise people around me.

## Photography/PhotoClicking
I decided to collect a lot of memories to look back in the future. So I started to take a lot of photos of my journey. Created a dedicated Instagram account [@duothoughtz](https://www.instagram.com/duothoughtz/) for nature and continued creating memories in the form of reels. I did create more memories on my self Instagram account [@ethirajchandru](https://www.instagram.com/ethirajchandru/). Lots of photos stay back in my hard disk. It is time to convert those photos into more beautiful memories
