# Know About Yourself from Google.md

It all started with this website - [https://camelcamelcamel.com](https://camelcamelcamel.com/).This website is a free Amazon price tracker. I was looking at the price of a product from amazon. I was annoyed by one particular ad in this website since it was following me where i go on the internet. So I closed that ad and it appeared as below

In the first place why do we see Google ads being published here. The reason is the publisher of this website is using [Google Adsense](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/#) to monetise the website. You could see that the material design of Google urges you to click on `Stop seeing this ad` and not `why this ad`. The reason Google gives preference to the former is due to its revenue principle which i will explain in the later half. I clicked on `why this ad`. It took me to a page where i further clicked on [Control your ad settings](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated) to go to ad personlisation page

I scrolled down and i could see various websites that i have visited for past few days and various factors on how my ad is personalised. Some of the few are listed below

I cliked on a factor and further linked on the link [Manage your activity](https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity). I could see all my activities being tracked under 5 major categories namely

* youtube
* search
* ads
* android
* image search
