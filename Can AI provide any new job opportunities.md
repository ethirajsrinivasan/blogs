## Can AI provide any new job opportunities?
Quite a few days we are talking about how AI is revolutionising the world and how it can optimise and automate our day to day job. Few even talk about how AI can replace job opportunities like Graphic Designers, Content Creators , Customer Service Agents etc. But today I am going to talk about a job opportunity provided by AI called the prompt engineering.

Prompt engineering is a technique used in language model to create specific inputs or prompts to get desired output from it. The objective of prompt engineering is to provide the models with the prompt that can help in the generation of text and improve its performance

The future of prompt engineering looks promising, as it has shown to improve the performance of language model to generate specific output. As more time passes by many scientists and developers will explore the possibilities of prompt engineering. We can see more advancement to streamline the process of prompt engineering and it will help many common people to access it. With the advancement of language models we can also expect complex prompts that helps us to generate more advanced and desired output.

Prompt engineering can be based on various techniques like the following:

## Template-based prompts:
Template based prompt is a type of prompt engineering in which predefined templates are used to get desired output from the model. The templates can help the model by providing specific information or to get a specific structured output.

Some examples as follows:

* **Social media post**: “[statement/question] What is your opinion”. eg “I did shopping at this new place and it was so much affordable. What is your opinion about it.”
* **Product description**: “This product is good for {target audience} because {benefits}”. eg “This face wash is good for people with oily skin because it clears the oiliness and keeps the face fresh throughout the day.”
* **Recommendation**: “If you liked [item], you will love [item]. eg “If you liked Inception, you will like tenet.”
* **Job description**: “We are hiring for [job title] who can [job responsibilities] with [qualifications]. eg “We are hiring for data scientist who can build accurate ML models with a degree in computer science / statistics / mathematics and experience with pytorch etc.”
Template based prompts are helpful because it helps to provide a proper structure to the output and helps to generate output that is informative and relevant. It can be customised for specific use cases and can be used with models like BERT or GPT.

## Controlled text generation:
Controlled text generation based prompts is helpful in guiding the language model to generate output based on certain criteria or constraint. It behaves like given a set of constraints it generates the output that is based on specific tone, style or topic.

Some examples as follows:

* **Tone specific generation**: Text generation based on specific tone like formal or informal. It is helpful to generate text which is consistent with a specific audience or context.
* **Topic specific generation**: Text generation based on specific topic. eg to generate news article for sports or politics.
* **Style specific generation**: Text generation based on styles like academic or creative writing. Helps to generate text with consistent genre or writing style.
* **Question-answering**: Text generation for question like FAQ or Customer Support response.
* **Story Completion**: Text generation to complete a story or narrative. It is used to generate creative writing prompts or to generate climax for stories.
Controlled text generation is used in a variety of applications like chatbot, text translation etc. By guiding the language model to generate output based on specific constraints it is possible to generate more accurate and useful output for a task.

## Multi-step prompts:
Multi step prompts is a type of prompt engineering in which a complex task is split into smaller steps. Each step is used to generate output which is used as input for the next step in the task. It is helpful in tasks that involves complex decision making or multiple steps.

Some examples as follows:

* **Decision Making**: Generates text that helps user in a complex decision making process with a series of questions and providing feedback based on the response. eg a financial advisor chatbot uses a series of prompts to decide on financial planning process.
* **Customer Support**: Generates text that helps user through a troubleshooting process by asking a series of questions and giving feedback based on the response. eg a customer support chatbot might use a series of prompts to diagnose a problem and resolve a technical issue
* **Resume Generation**: Generates a resume using multiple prompts for different sections of the resume like work experience, education, skills , awards and honours.
* **Story Generation**: Generates a outline of a story and then using a serious of prompts to generate content for each chapter of the story. The prompts can be based on different elements of the story like character , plot and genre.
Multi steps prompts helps to solve a complex decision making process or process multiple stages of information. By splitting a complex problem into smaller step it is possible to generate more accurate content for the user which is specifically desired for.

Hope prompt engineering brings many more opportunities for the human race!!!
