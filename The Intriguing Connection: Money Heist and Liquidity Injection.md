#### Liquidity Injection From Fiction toÂ Reality
Liquidity injection is the act of injecting additional money into the economy to improve growth and address recession. Central banks often use techniques like quantitative easing or fiscal stimulus packages to increase money supply and stimulate investment. Central Bank does it through the commercial banks which distributes loans to the common people at lower interest rate through increasing the money supply and getting out of recession.

Money Heist uses this technique of liquidity injection. The Professor's aim is to print billions of euros in the Royal Mint of Spain. His intention is not to steal people's money. He draws an analogy between his team and commercial banks stating that commercial banks tend to receive money from the central bank during the recession and only spend part of the money to ease the economic situation and the remaining amount is kept by them thereby directly benefitting from the liquidity injection.
